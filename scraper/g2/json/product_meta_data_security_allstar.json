            "ABOUT": "Corporate security relies greatly on User Access Management. A US FDA 483 Observation for Pharmaceutical and Biotech Companies may be issued in GMP environments if illegal access authorization is granted to application software and instrument software. The number of automated applications continues to increase in the Life Sciences Industry. Among these various software packages are ERP, LIMS, LMS, QMS, DMS, eBMR, eLogs, and Chromeleon, to mention just a few. Several Cloud solutions are also av.ilable to them along with on-premise ones. It is not uncommon for major corporations to have between 100 and 200 software applications.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to keep track of users, access permissions, role updates, license utilization, and compliance. Many leading pharmaceutical and biotech firms still use paper-based requests for access management. In the present-day manual procedures, unsafe access-related issues including duplicate identities, illegal access, limited or no validation of pre-requisites for access provisioning, absence of audit trails for access assignments, and other difficulties lead to major vulnerabilities. Identity and access management for users cannot be centrally managed.\n\nAssuring regulatory compliance and ensuring a smooth audit process can be made easier by providing a reliable system that can oversee, maintain, and manage user access permissions for the workforce, as well as track management authorizations for exceptions.\n\nAccording to data, more than 40% of user access rights are still in place after an account has been terminated. Inability to revoke access puts the firm open to attack (especially for SAAS applications) and makes it difficult to effectively employ User Licenses.\n\nAmpleLogic User Access Management Software, commonly known as identity and access management (IAM), is built in LOW-CODE NO-CODE (LCNC) PLATFORM. It aids in the provisioning and management of users\u2019 access to internal and external apps, as well as third-party SAAS permissions, based on their function and designation.\n\nUsing this software, IT managers can ensure that their employees have safe and secure access to the organization\u2019s services and facilities. A Universal Directory allows this to happen.\n\nUser Access and Permission Management Software ensures that your organization\u2019s security regulations are followed. It is linked to the Active Directory. AmpleLogic Identity and Access Management Software integrates seamlessly with SAP, HRMS, and Active Directory or LDAP.",

Its approach enables quick and iterative scans to identify critical security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC without compromising on quality or delivery speed. Bright empowers AppSec teams to provide governance for securing APIs and web apps while allowing developers to take ownership of security testingtion work. \n\nUnlike legacy DAST solutions built for AppSec professionals, which are complex to deploy and find vulnerabilities late in the development process, Bright's DAST solution is optimized for the DevOps world. It can be deployed as early as the Unit Testing phase and run throughout the SDLC, learning and optimizing from every scan. By enabling organizations to detect and remediate vulnerabilities early in the SDLC, Bright reduces risk at a lower cost and effort.",

            "ABOUT": "Labyrinth creates the illusion of a real infrastructure vulnerability for an attacker. The solution is based on Points, a smart host simulation. Each part of the simulation environment reproduces the services and content of an actual network segment. The system consists of four components that interact with each other. The main components of the Platform are: Admin VM is the main component. All collected information is sent to it for analysis. The console notifies the security team and sends.the necessary data to third-party systems.\n\nWorker  a host/virtual machine for deploying a set of Labyrinth network decoys (Points) on it. It can work in several VLANs simultaneously. Several Worker hosts can be connected to the same management console simultaneously. \n\nPoints are intelligent hosts that mimic software services, content, routers, devices, etc. Points detect all malicious activities within the corporate network, providing complete coverage of all possible attack vectors. \n\nSeeder agents deployed on servers and workstations imitate the most attractive file artifacts for an attacker. By creating various decoy files, the agent directs attackers to network decoys (Points) through their contents. \n\nThe Platform automatically deploys points (decoys) in the IT/OT network based on information about services and devices in the network environment. In addition, decoys can be deployed manually, providing users with a powerful tool to develop their unique deception platform based on their specific needs and best practices. The Labyrinth provokes an attacker to act and detects suspicious activity. As the attacker passes through the fake target infrastructure, the Platform captures all the details of the enemy. The security team receives information about the sources of threats, the tools used, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the attacker's behavior. At the same time, the entire real infrastructure continues to operate without any negative impact.",

Its capabilities make it possible to effectively identify vulnerabilities and backdoors using various analysis methods (SAST, DAST, SCA) and integrate with other tools for embedding in SSDLC. DerScanner supports static analysis that can check apps written in 36 programing languages. One of the distinctive features of the DerScanner SAST module is the ability to perform static analysis not only of the source code, but also of exes (binary code).\nIn addition to the static analysis module, DerScanner includes a dynamic analysis module that can analyze web applications for vulnerabilities by simulating malicious external attacks and exploiting common vulnerabilities. The DerScanner solution also provides correlation of static and dynamic analysis results, so that the vulnerabilities, found using the static method, can be dynamically validated. Therefore, correlation of the results obtained during the SAST and DAST analysis is one of the key advantages of using this solution.",

When technology investments are inadequate to counteract cyber attacks, the human factor is considered the most effective means of security and data defence. With phishing simulation, online training and incideneatures, Keepnet Labs transforms users into proactive agents who can actively identify and fight against cyber attacks.\n \n\n Because cyber attacks are carried out with human intelligence, combating it with human intelligence is the most realistic solution. It\u2019s difficult for organisations to measure the real benefits of investing in human-based cybersecurity \u2014 and as long as there isn\u2019t any damage \u2014 firms fall into an artificial sense of confidence. Keepnet Labs fixes these issues with the \u201cprocess solution\u201d, which enables companies to their own security processes and execute them \u2014 as well as create real-time development charts, monitor compliance with standards and live this life cycle.\n \n\n Our Phishing Simulator and Awareness Educator modules minimize your employees\u2019 susceptibility, and our Email Threat Simulator module proactively reduces the volume of inbox events. Our Incident Responder module is designed to catch the rest! The Incident Responder module allows users to report suspicious emails with one click, sending an email\u2019s content to us for header, body and attachment analysis. According to the malware result, Incident Responder creates a variety of attack signatures for alarm generation or blocking active security devices.\n \n\n Our Email Threat Simulator module regularly tests your technological investments (such as firewalls, anti-spam and anti-virus), using simulation logic to mimic the attack vectors targeting organisations through your email services. The results allow you to discover weaknesses in your technology in a safe environment and take the necessary action proactively before you\u2019re attacked.",

It is always better when the provider of your website components or the security researchers find the vulnerabilities before the hackers (Darknet, black market, etc.) do. However, sooner or later, any vulnerability becomes known to the security researchers, \u2013 before or after the hackers exploit this vulnerability for their attacks. The security researchers update special vulnerability databases, knowledge bases, security scanners and scanning engines as soon as possible, to help us uncover whether your websites are vulnerable or not.\nOur Website Security SCANNER and MONITOR are using several vulnerability databases and scanning engines to help better detect various website vulnerabilities. Some of the engines: Nikto, SSLscan, DNS Bruteforcer, DNS Zone Transfer analyzer, DNS Harvester, Robots.txt Analyzer, Bruteforce predictables discovery, Sqlmap, Wpscan, Joomscan, OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy, zaproxy). You do not have to install these engines on your computer, configure, schedule or run them manually. We do this for you. Moreover, we continuously monitor the security of your website and notify you, when its vulnerabilities increase or decrease. Now let us see how to use these services.",

            "ABOUT": "Your attack surface is the sum of every attack vector that can be used to breach your perimeter defenses. In other words, it is the total quantity of information you are exposing to the outside world. Typically, the larger the attack surface, the more opportunities hackers will have to find a weak link which they can then exploit to breach your network. Professional hackers typically follow the cyber kill chain when attacking a target, and surveying the target's attack surface is normally the v.ry first step in this process; what is known as advanced reconnaissance. Reducing the attack surface can minimize risk further down the cyber kill chain, preventing attacks before they even occur by eliminating potential attack vectors as early as possible. The cyber kill chain is a method of categorizing and tracking the various stages of a cyberattack from the early reconnaissance stages to the exfiltration of data. Quantum Armor aims at monitoring, managing and reducing your attack surface.",

That is why we have developed Tricent. \n \n\n Solution: \n Tricent helps you identify and remove externally shared files and Teams through automation. \n  \n \n\n How does it work?\n 1. Administrators set up automated compliance policies in less than 30 minutes\n 2. Tricent notifies users when their externally shared files and Teams need to be reviewed. If no action is taken by the user, Tricent will remove external access to the files. \n 3. Administrators get a full overview of the organization's shared data allowing for audits and bulk actions.\n  \n Key benefits: \n - Full control of data shared with external users\n Businesses can revoke all data shared by former employees in just a few clicks, mitigate ongoing sharings through automated compliance policies, get an overview of employee sharing statistics, delete inactive Teams, etc.\n  \n - Mitigate ongoing sharings through automated compliance policies\n IT admins can easily set a number of automated compliance policies for how often employees need to review their shared files or Teams. \n  \n - Involve the employees in the cleanup processes\n It\u2019s the users who know best what needs to stay shared when it comes to their work. That\u2019s why Tricent involves them in the cleanup process through notifications.  \n  \n We believe that what makes our solution unique is that it\u2019s simple, user-driven, and fully automated. \n  \n Getting started\n Book an introduction to Tricent on tricent.com/requestdemo \n  \n Onboarding to Tricent takes approximately 30-45 minutes. That\u2019s all. \n  \n Tricent works for Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 (including OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams).",

            "ABOUT": "Automate compliance in Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace with Tricent - a tool that helps you identify potential data exposures and remove external users from accessing your files and Teams. Problem: Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace cannot give you an overview of how many files and Teams are shared externally and with whom they are shared. This means that your data (shared by current and former employees) is out there - and this can pose a serious challenge to your data security and com.liance. That is why we have developed Tricent. \n \n\n Solution: \n Tricent helps you identify and remove externally shared files and Teams through automation. \n  \n \n\n How does it work?\n 1. Administrators set up automated compliance policies in less than 30 minutes\n 2. Tricent notifies users when their externally shared files and Teams need to be reviewed. If no action is taken by the user, Tricent will remove external access to the files. \n 3. Administrators get a full overview of the organization's shared data allowing for audits and bulk actions.\n  \n Key benefits: \n - Full control of data shared with external users\n Businesses can revoke all data shared by former employees in just a few clicks, mitigate ongoing sharings through automated compliance policies, get an overview of employee sharing statistics, delete inactive Teams, etc.\n  \n - Mitigate ongoing sharings through automated compliance policies\n IT admins can easily set a number of automated compliance policies for how often employees need to review their shared files or Teams. \n  \n - Involve the employees in the cleanup processes\n It\u2019s the users who know best what needs to stay shared when it comes to their work. That\u2019s why Tricent involves them in the cleanup process through notifications.  \n  \n We believe that what makes our solution unique is that it\u2019s simple, user-driven, and fully automated. \n  \n Getting started\n Book an introduction to Tricent on tricent.com/requestdemo \n  \n Onboarding to Tricent takes approximately 30-45 minutes. That\u2019s all. \n  \n Tricent works for Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 (including OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams).",

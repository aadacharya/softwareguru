Founded by a practicing physician and his patient, a successful software entrepreneur, our company tried a dramatically different approach when developing our electronic health records (EHR) systems. The result? Specialty-specific EHR technology that thinks like a physician. Our solutions hold a distinctive posithcare IT, blending smoothly into your practice. We believe that an EHR system shouldn\u2019t get in the way of how you practice medicine. It should function intelligently just like you and help you thrive under value-based care.\n\nBut our goal is to do more than give you a better EHR system. To help optimize the operational, financial and clinical sides of your practice, we\u2019ve developed a comprehensive suite of integrated healthcare solutions, including practice management, analytics, business operations services and more. These powerful products and services work together seamlessly with the EHR as part of a single system\u2014no separate logins or bridges necessary.\n\nTo take it one step further, we\u2019ve combined our products and services with structured treatment and outcomes data from millions of patient encounters. This gives you not only top-rated tools, but also in-depth nationwide medical knowledge to help you do what you do best: treat patients and improve healthcare.\n\nWe help doctors get work done faster and get out of the office sooner, because every minute matters\u2014in your medical practice and in your life.",

The software drastically reduces the amount of time that professionals spend in PowerPoint on formatting (titles, page numbers, bullets, etc.), which is important, but often painful to deal with. It\u2019s obvious your team spends a lot oing presentations. What you might not be aware of is that ~40% of their time in PowerPoint is spent formatting and editing presentations. That means you\u2019re paying your employees thousands of dollars a year to change colors, check page numbers, move titles and switch fonts. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be paying them to spend time on what matters most, your customers?

We share details about flight and budget changes, algorithmic changes and other elements that may not intuitively mean anything to our clients but are given the opportunity to educate them along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re agency people too and we understand the limitations of what agencies and brands alike face with a media company that insists on large monthly minimums.  Moreover, we know the frustration of seeing a lack of tactic mix and targeting strategies once you\u2019ve only crossed that minimum.  We ensure that no matter how large or small your campaign is, we include as much variety as we can\u2014i.e. Third-party data targeting, first-party data, or combination, contextual, etc., to capture the target audiences in the campaign, across all tactics we deploy such as OTT, Online Video, Native, Display, Audio, DOOH, Paid Search and Social.",

            "ABOUT": "Over the last decade, organizations have failed in their efforts to become data-driven. Data adoption in enterprises remains abysmally low because the last mile data delivery system is badly broken. Business users often fail to make data-led decisions because they don\u2019t get timely insights. In most organizations today, data is spread across multiple disconnected silos, needs an enormous amount of effort to prepare, and eventually, only a subset of this data gets used for analytics a\u2013 most data remains dark. Self-service BI tools fail to self-serve, and hence never get widely adopted, thereby creating a dependency on specialists to deliver dashboards, which often hide more than they show.\n\nWith a mission to truly consumerize BI,  Unscrambl built Qbo, an AI-powered data analyst for business users. Qbo directly connects to disparate data sources and does not require any data movement and preparation. Once connected, Qbo allows natural language conversations with the underlying data source(s) and surfaces results and automated insights in a meaningful fashion for the users. Importantly, users can access Qbo directly where they work - in their collaboration tool, and we have selected Microsoft Teams as our preferred launch platform. Zoom and Slack will follow.\n\nQbo is available as a SaaS offering or can be deployed by enterprises on-premise or in their own cloud environments. This makes it suitable for enterprises with highly sensitive data and stringent security needs.",

When technology investments are inadequate to counteract cyber attacks, the human factor is considered the most effective means of security and data defence. With phishing simulation, online training and incident response .eatures, Keepnet Labs transforms users into proactive agents who can actively identify and fight against cyber attacks.\n \n\n Because cyber attacks are carried out with human intelligence, combating it with human intelligence is the most realistic solution. It\u2019s difficult for organisations to measure the real benefits of investing in human-based cybersecurity \u2014 and as long as there isn\u2019t any damage \u2014 firms fall into an artificial sense of confidence. Keepnet Labs fixes these issues with the \u201cprocess solution\u201d, which enables companies to their own security processes and execute them \u2014 as well as create real-time development charts, monitor compliance with standards and live this life cycle.\n \n\n Our Phishing Simulator and Awareness Educator modules minimize your employees\u2019 susceptibility, and our Email Threat Simulator module proactively reduces the volume of inbox events. Our Incident Responder module is designed to catch the rest! The Incident Responder module allows users to report suspicious emails with one click, sending an email\u2019s content to us for header, body and attachment analysis. According to the malware result, Incident Responder creates a variety of attack signatures for alarm generation or blocking active security devices.\n \n\n Our Email Threat Simulator module regularly tests your technological investments (such as firewalls, anti-spam and anti-virus), using simulation logic to mimic the attack vectors targeting organisations through your email services. The results allow you to discover weaknesses in your technology in a safe environment and take the necessary action proactively before you\u2019re attacked.",

            "ABOUT": "For most organizations dealing with large populations of contractors, the task of assuring contract compliance is daunting. There just aren\u2019t enough people to properly control the workforce. Supervisors are stretched too thin and barely have time to initial the timesheets or approve an email. Approvals are given just so vendors can get paid. No time or upfront business processes exist to see if the terms of the contract are being followed. Time administrators and supervisors for bothnd contractor don't know if terms covering over-time, double-time, craft and skills matching, hourly rates and more are being followed. Lack of ability to enforce contract compliance is a second root cause of overpayment in manufacturing companies.\n \n\n Track automates contract compliance. It keeps an electronic version of the terms and conditions in the database and applies those to the hours captured during the shift. Exceptions are highlighted and not processed automatically until a supervisor reviews and approves them.\n \n\n Track enforces a best practice of allocating 100% of contract labor hours, regardless of whether the contract is T&M, Lump Sum, or Unit Rate. Allocating 100% of labor hours ensures that costs are not allocated twice and provides an excellent work history. The historical data of actual effort for specific projects becomes invaluable information when planning future works. It is easier to choose what type of contract to use for specific projects when there is a clear understanding of the actual effort required to complete the project.",

We have found that traditional or concurrent planning systems miss identifying these risks due to deviations between plans and execution. Production planners, who are many times several steps removed from network demand, can\u2019t even see the problems coming, much less solve for them, ending up in weekly firefighting attempting to resolve problems as they occur.  \n\n \nOur Production Flow product provides AI-driven predictive view of Value at Risk (VAR) due to network wide inventory-demand imbalances, tied to the near-term production plan. Alongside prescriptive recommendations, this enables production planners to make only high-value exceptions to the production plan to mitigate predicted lost sales or overage risks in the network. Production Flow also supports a collaborative risk resolution process between supply chain functions, by aligning to a single truth, VAR, to further improve organizational effectiveness and response.",

GRAALS stands for: Growth Strategies, RevOps, Automation & AI, Lead Generation, Smart Research. The truth is, in 2023 you don\u2019t want to be relying only on one or two acquisition channels. In that sense,.cold outreach with Email and LinkedIn is an amplifier to what you already have as a business, and a diversification play. Cold outreach is not only a way of closing more clients, it\u2019s also a fantastic source of traffic that you need to point toward your sales assets to be optimal.\n\nAccording to Salesforce, it takes up to 6-8 marketing touches to generate a viable sales lead. This is exactly why cold outreach has a different chance of success with businesses that have 0 sales assets and businesses that have tons of case studies. \n\nCompared to most other lead generation agencies on the market, at Wind Growth, we modeled our approach to take this into consideration when we work with a client. This allows us to see some holes your company might have and work with you to fix those so that cold outreach actually works for you.\n\nHere's what's included in term of lead generation:\n\n-Fast 1-On-1 Onboarding\n-Building a database of qualified leads\n-Crafting the best offer for your campaigns\n-AI SmartFlow Automation Setup\n-Weekly Reporting\n-Weekly 1-On-1 Meeting\n-DFY Managed Email Campaigns\n-DFY Managed LinkedIn Campaigns\n-AI Custom Videos Outreach\n-Custom Client App\n-KPI Dashboard\n-Fast Support\n\nCheck out our presentation video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgCSEQSpf-w",

We have found that traditional or concurrent planning systems that leverage static rules are unable to identify these risks. As a result, most inventory planners can\u2019t even see the problems coming, much less solve for them, firefighting and attempting to resolve problems as they occur.  \n\n \nOur Inventory Flow product provides AI-driven predictive risks due to supply / demand imbalance and translates and prioritizes them on Value at Risk (VAR) that is measurable and actionable for the business. Alongside prescriptive recommendations, this enables inventory planners to take proactive, targeted inventory deployment actions to mitigate risks before they materialize. Inventory Flow supports a collaborative risk resolution process across regions and functions by aligning to a single source of truth, VAR, to further improve organizational effectiveness and response actions, capturing business value through improved fill rates achieved at lower cost due to right-sizing inventory levels throughout the network.",

            "ABOUT": "Unveiling Opportunities with the Whois Database for Strategic Marketing In the dynamic internet landscape, domain registration trends shape digital identities and interactions. Around 33,000 domain registrations occur daily. Recognizing these trends is vital for maintaining a competitive online presence. WHOIS Database offers comprehensive insights into the proprietors of domains of interest. The WHOIS database is a centralized repository of information containing details about domgistered on the internet. It provides essential information about domain ownership, registration dates, contact information for domain owners, and other technical information related to domain management.\n\nUse of Whois Database\n\n#1: Recognize and Establish Relationships with Buyers and Sellers\nIn digital marketing, usual research methods aren\u2019t enough for creating or improving new marketing strategies. It\u2019s crucial for businesses to precisely identify the right consumers to stay ahead.\n\nThe WHOIS database helps marketers get domain ownership records, collecting important contact details. This makes it easier to connect with potential buyers and sellers.\n\n#2: Enhance Content Marketing Strategies\nContent marketing is a powerful strategy for attracting the right audience. But sometimes, great content can struggle if it\u2019s on a less credible domain. So, marketers want ways to check domain credibility.\n\nMany believe older domains are more credible. A WHOIS database can tell you a domain\u2019s age. It gives you a list of older domains (which are generally more credible) that match your business needs.\n\n#3: Track Competitor Activities\u200b\nFor marketing managers, studying competitors is crucial. It helps them understand market trends and find new opportunities based on rivals\u2019 strategies.\n\nUsing the WHOIS Database shows all domains competitors use. Sometimes, new domain registrations indicate new business plans, like entering new markets or launching products.\n\n#4: Attain Domain Insights for Growth Opportunities\u200b\u200b\nCompanies aiming to expand often rely on marketing teams to plan new ventures. This usually means getting new domains for their latest offerings.\n\nUsing the WHOIS Database helps find domains that match business goals. Once marketers find desired domains, they can quickly check if they\u2019re available. If not, having ownership details from the WHOIS Database helps them find contacts to discuss buying the domains.",

            "ABOUT": "Summary and Relevance for Covid-19 Desk Sharing is a solution for desk reservations. It has become more and more relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic with its regulations like safety distances. Office administrators can comply with latest policies by increasing or decreasing the number of available desks. Some companies expanded during the pandemic, hiring home office workers. The new workers didn\u2019t get a dedicated desk and there is simply not enough space for everybody. Plus, eve \u201cHome office is here to stay\u201d. Why bother about creating more office space? Just make sure to avoid overbooking on popular days and monitor desk utilization.\nAnother case for many companies around the globe is: 2020-2021 did not go as planned. If you need to downsize the office space due to cost reduction, desk sharing is the perfect solution to support hybrid work.\nWith the Desk Sharing solution, users easily see available desks in real time on the browser or via dedicated displays on site. The booking covers the walk-in situation for the next hours and supports those users who like to plan the next weeks from home. The latter can do convenient multi-bookings for the days they\u2019re planning to visit the office.\nThe solution can be deployed based on programs like O635, Microsoft Exchange or Google Workspace (formerly GSuite). But it\u2019s capable of running without calendar integrations.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\nThe main view gives a visual orientation on the floor plan including custom orientation objects like doors, walls, copy machines. This view shows red and green elements, giving the reservation status of desks or workstations.\nOn each floor, customers can choose to operate big overview displays or tablets. All users can access the floor plans also on their PCs/smartphones. Users are in the situation of asking \u201cWhich desk is free for how many hours?\u201d or \u201cWhere is the desk I booked yesterday?\u201d. In a walk-in booking, users can check for availability based on time slots or check the layout plan. This is a visual search for free space. Another use case supported here is: \u201c26 of 40 desks are free but I want to sit close to my team leader whom I can see over there\u201d. The booking is done by pressing on the desk.\nThe booking for future days usually works in a way that users specify the location and day. The free tables can be recognized by their green coloring. Through additional color coding, it is apparent whether a desk is occupied for the full day, booked only for the morning or for the afternoon. The bookings of the colleagues are listed with their names. Select and confirm - done. If there are special requirements for the workplace, these can be called up via additional information (e.g. two monitors or specific equipment). Pictures can also be stored. Accepted reservations are confirmed by email and include links to import calendar entries for Outlook, Google calendar or other client programs.\n\n\nAdvanced Upgrade Options\n\n\nIf one has arrived at the last meters, there are further concepts to support wayfinding or to display the status. Optional mini-displays showing the booking status on each desk - similar to a digital meeting room door sign. Some customers prefer to have one tablet display for a group of desks inside the open office. To save hardware costs for tablets, android boxes could be implemented as well. Those are connected to the existing monitors as a 2nd HDMI input source. Another option is to integrate 3rd party standalone programmable LEDs to give visibility from distance. Depending on the customer\u2019s requirements, occupancy can be processed using sensors. The solution can be deployed within a day. In big office environments with hundreds of desks it needs a project approach to satisfy individual requirements like advanced integrations.",

Unified Remix bases the playlist on a general ruleset triggered by a CMS, a recommendation system, or other business rules. It then transforms the remixed MP4 playlist into input for Unified Origin and Unified Packager, both of which can deliver all playout formats. The result: a unified approach to delivering to all devices from a single playlist.",

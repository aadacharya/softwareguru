            "ABOUT": "Corporate security relies greatly on User Access Management. A US FDA 483 Observation for Pharmaceutical and Biotech Companies may be issued in GMP environments if illegal access authorization is granted to application software and instrument software. The number of automated applications continues to increase in the Life Sciences Industry. Among these various software packages are ERP, LIMS, LMS, QMS, DMS, eBMR, eLogs, and Chromeleon, to mention just a few. Several Cloud solutions ilable to them along with on-premise ones. It is not uncommon for major corporations to have between 100 and 200 software applications.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to keep track of users, access permissions, role updates, license utilization, and compliance. Many leading pharmaceutical and biotech firms still use paper-based requests for access management. In the present-day manual procedures, unsafe access-related issues including duplicate identities, illegal access, limited or no validation of pre-requisites for access provisioning, absence of audit trails for access assignments, and other difficulties lead to major vulnerabilities. Identity and access management for users cannot be centrally managed.\n\nAssuring regulatory compliance and ensuring a smooth audit process can be made easier by providing a reliable system that can oversee, maintain, and manage user access permissions for the workforce, as well as track management authorizations for exceptions.\n\nAccording to data, more than 40% of user access rights are still in place after an account has been terminated. Inability to revoke access puts the firm open to attack (especially for SAAS applications) and makes it difficult to effectively employ User Licenses.\n\nAmpleLogic User Access Management Software, commonly known as identity and access management (IAM), is built in LOW-CODE NO-CODE (LCNC) PLATFORM. It aids in the provisioning and management of users\u2019 access to internal and external apps, as well as third-party SAAS permissions, based on their function and designation.\n\nUsing this software, IT managers can ensure that their employees have safe and secure access to the organization\u2019s services and facilities. A Universal Directory allows this to happen.\n\nUser Access and Permission Management Software ensures that your organization\u2019s security regulations are followed. It is linked to the Active Directory. AmpleLogic Identity and Access Management Software integrates seamlessly with SAP, HRMS, and Active Directory or LDAP.",

Using machine learning, WhizzCo predicts which vendor will produce the highest CPM for a specific impression according to geo, device, website, widget layout, widget location, and more, so the best performing CR is always placed for a particular asset. But you don\u2019t need to take our word for it...you can clearly see the comparative performance of all the vendors on WhizzCo's unified and intuitive dashboard.",

            "ABOUT": "Meet Gataca Studio, the all-in-one platform streamlining the issuance, verification, and management of identity credentials and facilitating the integration of Self-Sovereign Identity into your website or application. Features: Issue verifiable credentials - Create and digitally sign tamper-proof credentials according to W3C and ISO standards for global interoperability. Verify credentials - Design customizable verification templates for onboarding and sign-in processes to offer  access to digital services. \n\nManage credentials lifecycle - View, suspend, and revoke issued credentials. \n\nMonitor users' activity - Review all verification instances executed (data consents) and revoke authenticated users. \n\nID Wallet - Let your users authenticate seamlessly in digital services and take control of their data.\n\nWhy choose Gataca? \n\nSeamless integration - Gataca Studio is a low-code platform. Set it up in seconds with our plug & play deployment system. \n\nEasy to use - Adopting SSI technology can be very challenging for organizations. We\u2019ve simplified the process so you can focus on your core business. \n\nInfrastructure-agnostic - Our platform provides flexible integration capabilities with diverse blockchain networks, databases, and centralized Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). \n\nCompliance by design - Gataca products are purpose-built to seamlessly incorporate GDPR, eIDAS, KYC, and other relevant regulations. \n\nBenefits of using Gataca's Self-Sovereign Identity technology: \n\nReduce identity fraud - User data and ID credentials are issued by trusted authorities and protected with biometrics and post-quantum cryptography to ensure they are tamper-proof, allowing instant identity verification without relying on centralized systems.\n\nSave in compliance costs - The operational cost of a KYC or onboarding process falls remarkably as the same data no longer needs to be verified multiple times across different services. Users hold pre-verified identity information and decide with whom to share their data and when to revoke access, instantly complying with data privacy regulations. \n\nImprove user experience - SSI combines the simplicity and usability of a Single Sign-On with advanced cryptography that provides government-grade secured access to digital services, eliminating friction during onboardings and lowering abandonment rates.\n\nInterconnect with Web 3.0 - SSI can be used in both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 instances and is the ideal partner to transition to a user-centric identity model.",

            "RATING": 4.5,
            "ABOUT": "Meeting Room Schedule is a software solution for managing meetings rooms on door displays. It runs on wall mounted Android Tablets next to the door of your meeting room. You can easily book rooms from the tablet for walk-in meetings or for events in the future. It provides you an overview of all available rooms, giving status information about free meeting time slots. It integrates resource calendars like Office3365, MS Exchange or Google Workspace (formerly GSuite). No additional to for PC bookings from Outlook or Google Calendar. Work like you did before and get more features at the door display. Waiting for your meeting to start and wondering who will be joining? Check the acceptance status of the participants. \n\nIf you\u2019re managing your rooms with paper, you\u2019ll be surprised about how much time this solution is going to save. Think of all the work for each change. Instead you can update the display with a few klicks and changes are shown in real-time. Your administrative staff can focus on the essentials and you\u2019ll save tons of paper.  \n\nThe catering team can access information about the event and knows what needs to be prepared. It also helps your visitors to find the right room and displays the overview schedule for a larger event.  \nTypical time-wasters are double bookings or other reservation conflicts due to poor organization or lack of transparency in occupancy plans. Door displays avoid these problems by displaying real-time updated room occupancy, booking processes directly on the display or even the automatic cancellation of a booking in case of non-use, which leads to a significantly better utilization of the rooms. \nWe as Schedule Display offer solutions for Android-based tablets. We propose preferring professional displays over consumer devices or e-ink based solutions. We are convinced that an interactive, color touch display with good resolution offers the best functionality for room reservations. The customer has the highest long term flexibility because this choice gives the biggest variety of software vendors and customer-driven extensions in functionality can be implemented very quickly. Before making a decision, the solution can be piloted very easily with a consumer tablet. Different types of end users can be involved in the selection process.  \n\nThe most common display sizes for door signs are 7 inch or 10 inch, larger displays such as 12 inch or in large format are becoming increasingly popular. Large displays are considered to be the right choice for bigger halls and for displays showing the overview of all rooms. If the corridors are long, users face the following problem: The room availability is only visible after many steps, when they have reached the display. Here, professional displays with external side LEDs for status indication (green/red) offer good visibility from the distance. \nIf you prefer a tablet or display solution with power supply, there are various options. Power can usually be provided from above/below/behind, depending on the individual situation and availability of power or Ethernet (PoE). There are a variety of mounting and cable routing concepts. Depending on the number of rooms, whether it\u2019s a new construction or room upgrade, the customers\u2019 budget, installation skills of the IT department or building services and specifications of the procurement strategy, the answer may be different.",

That might sound like a reach, but account statements with a creditor reference are actually a Finnish innovation. In the context of cash management, too many corporates still suffer from scattered, unharmonized, and inefficient treasury, cash and financial processes. These inefficiencies lead to challenges such as globally multi-billion problem of payment fraud, while trapped cash, and sibility, and weak cash forecasts lead to treasuries not having the cash in hand to manage daily operations and invest back in the business.\n\nNomentia, was born from the foundation of two leading cash management providers, Analyste and OpusCapita, who firmly believe in Nordic innovation and strong heritage of advanced financial processes. The tools of modern cash management were born in Finland. We take pride in offering the widest and wildest, and the most modern cash management portfolio in the market.\n\nWe find our passion in modernizing customers\u2019 processes, showing our superior expertise, and providing them solutions and tools that are pleasant to work with to help reach their targets to harmonize, gain synergies, and boost productivity.\n\nWe provide best-of-breed solutions for liquidity management, corporate payments and automated bank account reconciliation.",

That might sound like a reach, but account statements with a creditor reference are actually a Finnish innovation. In the context of cash management, too many corporates still suffer from scattered, unharmonized, and inefficient treasury, cash and financial processes. These inefficiencies lead to challenges such as globally multi-billion problem of payment fraud, while trapped cash, and poor cash v.sibility, and weak cash forecasts lead to treasuries not having the cash in hand to manage daily operations and invest back in the business.\n\nNomentia, was born from the foundation of two leading cash management providers, Analyste and OpusCapita, who firmly believe in Nordic innovation and strong heritage of advanced financial processes. The tools of modern cash management were born in Finland. We take pride in offering the widest and wildest, and the most modern cash management portfolio in the market.\n\nWe find our passion in modernizing customers\u2019 processes, showing our superior expertise, and providing them solutions and tools that are pleasant to work with to help reach their targets to harmonize, gain synergies, and boost productivity.\n\nWe provide best-of-breed solutions for liquidity management, corporate payments and automated bank account reconciliation.",

And yet you may create your own builders and extend your app with no limits. It's just like in a Lego constructor. Though you are not building an application from rectional blocks \u201a\u00c4\u00ee you need to make these blocks yourself from the simplest bits.

With Paydit, you can adjust every key parameter of debt negotiation and settlement to fit your internal processes and business requirements. These parameters include the number of installmentptions, billing, and more. As a result, you make the entire workflow more stress-free and convenient.\n\nThe Variety of Debt Settlement Options\n\nThe consumer can choose how to repay the debt, depending on the rules you set and their own preferences.  \n\nPay in full \u2014 the consumer makes a one-time payment, settling the debt at once, or repays in installments.\nNegotiate to pay less \u2014 Paydit offers payment plans through which the consumer can pay a percent from the debt. Alternatively, they can try to renegotiate the amount to pay if none of those is affordable.\nFlexible payments \u2014 negotiate payment plans for a part of the past-due account or create your own plan that meets the consumer\u2019s budget and schedule.\n\nSecure Debt Settlement  \n\nBesides the integrated payment processors, Paydit allows you to add other payment providers that you trust to guarantee secure payments to consumers.\n\nComprehensive analytics \n\nAssess performance and consumer activities on the go with our detailed reports.\n\nFull compliance \n\nFinally, Paydit is about compliance. The automation algorithms facilitate settling debts while following FDCPA and TCPA. For example, our solution automates legal wording in letters to be sent to consumers, choosing the right time to make calls.   \nTo top it all off, Paydit is easily adjustable to local regulations, ensuring auditable consumer interaction.",

We have found that traditional or concurrent planning systems miss identifying these risks due to deviations between plans and execution. Production planners, who are many times several steps removed from network demand, can\u2019t even see the problems coming, much less solve for them, ending up in weekly firefighting attempting to resolve problems as they occur.  \n\n \nOur Production Flow product provides AI-driven predictive view of Value at Risk (VAR) due to network wide inventory-demand imbalances, tied to the near-term production plan. Alongside prescriptive recommendations, this enables production planners to make only high-value exceptions to the production plan to mitigate predicted lost sales or overage risks in the network. Production Flow also supports a collaborative risk resolution process between supply chain functions, by aligning to a single truth, VAR, to further improve organizational effectiveness and response.",

Your team doesn't need to re-type them in, worry about errors or even teach our AI. We'll do that (enlisting the supplier who cares more about it too!). Address invoice rejections and warnings to suppliers before submission: Comparing the supplier's Invoice header and line details tation in the Purchase Order, Contract, Service Agreement will highlight any Validation issues for the Supplier to resolve before officially submitting. Valid Invoices generate fewer supplier rejections from your AP process.\nFocus AP Reconciliation on internal issues across all Invoice sources:\nWith a touchless path for supplier-specific invoices to join cXML/EDI and POFlip generated Invoices in the same Reconciliation workflow, the AP team can enjoy greater efficiencies for resolving Invoice approval and accounting issues. Suppliers adopt because they don't have to change much either.",

            "RATING": 5.0,
            "ABOUT": "For most organizations dealing with large populations of contractors, the task of assuring contract compliance is daunting. There just aren\u2019t enough people to properly control the workforce. Supervisors are stretched too thin and barely have time to initial the timesheets or approve an email. Approvals are given just so vendors can get paid. No time or upfront business processes exist to see if the terms of the contract are being followed. Time administrators and supervisors for bothnd contractor don't know if terms covering over-time, double-time, craft and skills matching, hourly rates and more are being followed. Lack of ability to enforce contract compliance is a second root cause of overpayment in manufacturing companies.\n \n\n Track automates contract compliance. It keeps an electronic version of the terms and conditions in the database and applies those to the hours captured during the shift. Exceptions are highlighted and not processed automatically until a supervisor reviews and approves them.\n \n\n Track enforces a best practice of allocating 100% of contract labor hours, regardless of whether the contract is T&M, Lump Sum, or Unit Rate. Allocating 100% of labor hours ensures that costs are not allocated twice and provides an excellent work history. The historical data of actual effort for specific projects becomes invaluable information when planning future works. It is easier to choose what type of contract to use for specific projects when there is a clear understanding of the actual effort required to complete the project.",

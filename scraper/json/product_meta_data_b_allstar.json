The number is large enough to handle all of the agencies/groups either combined or separately \u2022 The software uses a non-identifiable key for employee identification (i.e., no SSN). The software can use employee id from our HR software (Advantage HR). \u2022 The softomate the notification of tests to HR Managers.\n\u2022\tThe software allows for the tracking and retaining of all testing notifications.\n\u2022\tThe software produces a report identifying those employees required to report for testing, including the date of the test, to allow for manual notification.\n\u2022\tThe software allows multiple roles within the application (i.e., administrator, selector, view only) with various staff members within each function, with appropriate security for each role.\n\u2022\tThe software performs randomization in an industry acceptable manner that is legally defendable if necessary.\n\u2022\tThe software provides reports or data for ad hoc reports to verify required testing rates for a select group of the testing completed. Examples of these subsets would be for a government reporting agency (i.e., FMCSA, DOT, etc.) or to verify union agreements - only random tests. The software allows for the modification of the testing rates or percentages for the government agencies.\n\u2022\tSoftware legal identification of any incident allows for the retention of records indefinitely when a claim has been placed against the County, Agency, or an Employee.\n\u2022\tThe software allows for an employee to be flagged if they are out on extended leave\u2019(usually > 30 days).  \n\u2022\tThe software allows for the selection pool for a random test to be a specific shift/group (i.e., A, B, C, or D). The software will enable employees to be selected for different test types (i.e. Drugs, Alcohol or Both).\n\u2022\t The software allows for the selection pool for a random test to be based on job function (i.e. safety-sensitive positions).\n\u2022\tThe software allows for the selection pool for a random test to be based on government requirements (i.e. separate pools for FTA or FMCSA).",

We have found that traditional or concurrent planning systems that leverage static rules are unable to identify these risks. As a result, most inventory planners can\u2019t even see the problems coming, much less solve for them, firefighting and attempting to resolve problems as they occur.  \n\n \nOur Inventory Flow product provides AI-driven predictive risks due to supply / demand imbalance and translates and prioritizes them on Value at Risk (VAR) that is measurable and actionable for the business. Alongside prescriptive recommendations, this enables inventory planners to take proactive, targeted inventory deployment actions to mitigate risks before they materialize. Inventory Flow supports a collaborative risk resolution process across regions and functions by aligning to a single source of truth, VAR, to further improve organizational effectiveness and response actions, capturing business value through improved fill rates achieved at lower cost due to right-sizing inventory levels throughout the network.",

            "ABOUT": "An annual downtime of 27 days can cost an offshore oil operation $88M! Lapses in asset reliability result in downtimes, and these downtimes result in companies investing in back-up equipment to ensure uptime. Consequently, they multiply their operations\u2019 carbon footprint. This had led the globally sustainability technology market, already valued at$11B, on a path to cross $36B by 2025. In addition to this, heavy industrial machinery\u2019s reliability management in operations is an exacerem growing at >10% Y-o-Y and is expected to cross $24B by 2025.\nAt Eugenie, we\u2019ve built two products called Ray-Finn and Papillon, which ingest high-velocity, multi-variate data from machine-plugged sensors and SCADA system to predict machinery failures to enable proactive preventive maintenance using patented algorithms, deep technology, AI, and unsupervised ML. The improved reliability management afforded by this reduces dependency on backup systems, helping reduce the carbon footprint contribution of these systems, thus making the overall industrial operations more sustainable.\n\nEugenie\u2019s team comprises global talent holding PhDs and post-graduate degrees from the top academic institutes in India and globally. We\u2019re funded by Fractal Analytics and our vision is validated by the fact that we\u2019ve worked with organizations ranging from the world\u2019s 2nd largest oil major, to a unit of the Indian defense forces.\n\nThe problem we\u2019re addressing is a pressing concern of decision-makers globally; On Earth Day 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 50% by 2030. Following this, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the U.K. would cut emissions 78% by 2035. In addition to this, the E.U. pledged to cut emissions 55% by 2030, and finally, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro preponed Brazil\u2019s deadline for carbon-neutrality from 2060 to 2050.",

Lightning Fast Continuous Localization Setup [10ere's what it takes for a native iOS app to go from a single language app to a multilingual app. \n(1) Developer sets up upload integration with Xcode build system [takes 1 minute]\n(2) Strings will collect and compile all untranslated strings from Objective-C, XiB, Storyboards, etc. [takes 1 minute]\n(3) Strings will generate and compile translation context cues to feed AI translation engine [takes 1 minute]\n(4) Developer chooses languages they would like to support [takes 30 seconds]\n(5) Strings immediately starts translating and sends notification once translations are done [5 minutes]\n(6) Developer sets up download integration with Xcode build system [takes 1 minute]\n(7) Strings integrates translations back into Xcode project and triggers pull request in CI/CD process [takes 30 seconds]\n\nAnd you're done! Continuous localization is setup and now every time developers push new features, Strings will work in the background to ensure they have multilingual support. \n\nIt's seriously that easy :)",

Features: Issue verifiable credentials - Create and digitally sign tamper-proof credentials according to W3C and ISO standards for global interoperability. Verify credentials - Design customizable verification templates for onboarding and sign-in processes to offer  access to digital services. \n\nManage credentials lifecycle - View, suspend, and revoke issued credentials. \n\nMonitor users' activity - Review all verification instances executed (data consents) and revoke authenticated users. \n\nID Wallet - Let your users authenticate seamlessly in digital services and take control of their data.\n\nWhy choose Gataca? \n\nSeamless integration - Gataca Studio is a low-code platform. Set it up in seconds with our plug & play deployment system. \n\nEasy to use - Adopting SSI technology can be very challenging for organizations. We\u2019ve simplified the process so you can focus on your core business. \n\nInfrastructure-agnostic - Our platform provides flexible integration capabilities with diverse blockchain networks, databases, and centralized Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). \n\nCompliance by design - Gataca products are purpose-built to seamlessly incorporate GDPR, eIDAS, KYC, and other relevant regulations. \n\nBenefits of using Gataca's Self-Sovereign Identity technology: \n\nReduce identity fraud - User data and ID credentials are issued by trusted authorities and protected with biometrics and post-quantum cryptography to ensure they are tamper-proof, allowing instant identity verification without relying on centralized systems.\n\nSave in compliance costs - The operational cost of a KYC or onboarding process falls remarkably as the same data no longer needs to be verified multiple times across different services. Users hold pre-verified identity information and decide with whom to share their data and when to revoke access, instantly complying with data privacy regulations. \n\nImprove user experience - SSI combines the simplicity and usability of a Single Sign-On with advanced cryptography that provides government-grade secured access to digital services, eliminating friction during onboardings and lowering abandonment rates.\n\nInterconnect with Web 3.0 - SSI can be used in both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 instances and is the ideal partner to transition to a user-centric identity model.",

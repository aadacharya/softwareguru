Photogrammetry uses aerial shots or drone photos or satellite images to determine the spatial properties and dimensions of the objects/features captured in the photographic image. IGiS Photogrammetry Suite a product of IGiS powered by Scanpoint Gited brings off one click photogrammetry solution for processing digital images and converting the same to 3D, which will be an useful input  for GIS software, special effect building and to take proxy measurement of objects of different scales. It also supports: \n\nFully automated geodesy and Photogrammetry tools for image to 3D: Designed for processing stereo imagery captured from various satellites, aircrafts and drones with and without camera information. Photogrammetry process uses camera model and RPC imagery information. A simple automated workflow, highly accurate survey grade outputs and high-speed parallel processing makes the IGiS Photogrammetry Suite unique.\n\nDynamic and Automated Processing Workflow: The fully automated workflow of IGiS Photogrammetry covers all steps of stereo processing including mosaicing, GCP extraction, bundle block adjustment, tie point generation, alignment, masking, correlation, triangulation, creating 3D photogrammetry models, DEM generation, hole-fill and smoothing. Novice users can use the automated suite without any prior training using the user-friendly GUI while professionals can use individual modules. The suite also contains advanced tools and scripts/macros for batch processing and tailored solutions.\n \nHigh Accuracy Outputs: We have successfully developed efficient algorithms to achieve survey-grade accuracy using high-speed GPU and core based processing. There is no data size limitation for processing and analysis. It produces cartographic products, including Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and Ortho Rectified Imagery with accuracy report. A user can export final output in different formats like Raster DEM, vector 3D points and 3D Mash/TIN for further visualisation and analysis.\n\nDEM Editing and Analysis: IGiS Photogrammetry suite provides a wide array of tools to process and analyse DEM/DTM and 3D photogrammetry point vector data. Seamless mosaicing for advanced visualisation and analysis is carried out by DEM and 3D Point Mosaic tools. An advance analysis can be done using tools like DEM to Contour, Volume Calculation, 3D Change Detection, DTM to DSM, Slope, Aspect, Hill-Shade, DEM hole-fill and smoothing.",

            "ABOUT": "BuildBubbles - Unlimited Podcasts With Sound Design From Your WordPress Articles More people are blogging than ever. But at the same time, more people today prefer to listen rather than read. So, we thought: What if bloggers could offer a way for people to listen to their content? Converting a written blog to a podcast involves what\u2019s known as text-to-speech. But text-to-speech alone cannot create podcasts that connect with people. Good podcasts need more than a voice to tell the seed music and rhythm to create an emotional impact.\n\nThat\u2019s why we came up with BuildBubbles. It\u2019s a web app that can help bloggers easily make awesome podcasts without a microphone or studio equipment.\n\nBloggers do not even need to know how to edit the podcast. BuildBubbles converts written blog posts into compelling podcasts with sound design! With BuildBubbles, your blog will stand out and you\u2019ll reach a much wider audience.\n\nAs a content provider, you spend a lot of time creating interesting content. Make sure it reaches as many people as possible!\n\nBuildBubbles is easy and intuitive. Just three steps and a few minutes and it\u2019s done!\n1. Paste a link of your WordPress blog post you\u2019d like to convert to a podcast\n2. Choose the BuildBubbles podcast template and voices you want\n3. Edit your podcast if you wish.\n\nOnce you\u2019re finished, you can download it or embed it in your blog.\n\nPlease try it! We\u2019d love to hear your feedback.\nhttps://buildbubbles.com/",

Qnect takes the bulk of the connections, automates the engineering, and automates the modeling of connections into the 3D model.

All this information brought together makes reporting and analytics of important data such as pay compression easy to escalate throughout the organizators also provides easy avenues for organizations to expand into key areas such as job descriptions, compensation planning and pay equity analysis. We foster a sense of collaborative compensation that means users can bring key people into the process to provide feedback along the way and to help them better understand the parameters in which pay decisions should be made.

We then wanted to create a journey and right then Microlearning was what we chose as the road ahead. This was, is and will be with an intent to help Authors break learning content inort, targeted, focused, bite-sized chunks with the sole purpose of engaging learners. Though it was the primary intention, as KREDO evolved, reinforcing information and knowledge retention also became an inseparable add on. KREDO increases the learning outcomes, helps solve unlimited questions, and swiftly gets your queries answered. Permission and access rights are always a point of debate but when KREDO was launched, they were the core questions we wanted to have answered for every organization adopting KREDO. To cap it off, we are the best cost-effective Learning Platform in the world.",

            "ABOUT": "For most organizations dealing with large populations of contractors, the task of assuring contract compliance is daunting. There just aren\u2019t enough people to properly control the workforce. Supervisors are stretched too thin and barely have time to initial the timesheets or approve an email. Approvals are given just so vendors can get paid. No time or upfront business processes exist to see if the terms of the contract are being followed. Time administrators and supervisors for bothnd contractor don't know if terms covering over-time, double-time, craft and skills matching, hourly rates and more are being followed. Lack of ability to enforce contract compliance is a second root cause of overpayment in manufacturing companies.\n \n\n Track automates contract compliance. It keeps an electronic version of the terms and conditions in the database and applies those to the hours captured during the shift. Exceptions are highlighted and not processed automatically until a supervisor reviews and approves them.\n \n\n Track enforces a best practice of allocating 100% of contract labor hours, regardless of whether the contract is T&M, Lump Sum, or Unit Rate. Allocating 100% of labor hours ensures that costs are not allocated twice and provides an excellent work history. The historical data of actual effort for specific projects becomes invaluable information when planning future works. It is easier to choose what type of contract to use for specific projects when there is a clear understanding of the actual effort required to complete the project.",

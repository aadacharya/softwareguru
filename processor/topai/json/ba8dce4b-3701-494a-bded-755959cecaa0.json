{"product_summary": "Mastodon is a free and open-source decentralized social network. It is a microblogging platform where users can share short messages, images, and videos. Mastodon is similar to Twitter, but it is not owned by a single company. Instead, it is a network of independent servers that are run by different people and organizations.

(3) Level 3: Managed Usage automates license harvesting. It expands the capabilities of the first two levels and provides better control for managing license resources by discovering and terminating or suspending applications that are not in active use. LicenseAnalyzer 2022 has been updated to v9.18 to include new improvements, features, and bug fixes. Its new features include the following: 1.

As I was becoming increasingly familiar with this interface, I started realizing that VSCode offered a vast array of shortcuts. However, while I knew of the existence of such shortcuts, it was unclear which one performed a particular function. As a result, finding our which shortcuts were handy for useful and ultimately incorporating them in mproved to be an unnecessarily time-consuming task.\n \n\n To overcome this, I have created VSCheatsheet which uses .gifs to illustrate the function of each shortcut. Each illustration, shows in a simple and straight-forward manner the effect of pressing a particular shortcut. A pop-up with the keys pressed is shown at the exact timing the command is given. A prescription of the keys to be pressed for a function (in each particular operating system) is provided at the bottom of the relevant illustration.\n \n\n \ud83d\udc49 15+ illustrations of the most frequently-used shortcuts\n \ud83d\udc49 5+ illustrations of selected extensions that would enhance your productivity\n \ud83d\udc49 newsletter alerts for new shortcuts added in the future\n \n\n Our team welcomes all constructive feedback and shortcut requests by users to optimize this product and create a value-enhancing experience",

            "RATING": 4.5,
            "ABOUT": "Summary and Relevance for Covid-19 Desk Sharing is a solution for desk reservations. It has become more and more relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic with its regulations like safety distances. Office administrators can comply with latest policies by increasing or decreasing the number of available desks. Some companies expanded during the pandemic, hiring home office workers. The new workers didn\u2019t get a dedicated desk and there is simply not enough space for everybody. Plus, eve \u201cHome office is here to stay\u201d. Why bother about creating more office space? Just make sure to avoid overbooking on popular days and monitor desk utilization.\nAnother case for many companies around the globe is: 2020-2021 did not go as planned. If you need to downsize the office space due to cost reduction, desk sharing is the perfect solution to support hybrid work.\nWith the Desk Sharing solution, users easily see available desks in real time on the browser or via dedicated displays on site. The booking covers the walk-in situation for the next hours and supports those users who like to plan the next weeks from home. The latter can do convenient multi-bookings for the days they\u2019re planning to visit the office.\nThe solution can be deployed based on programs like O635, Microsoft Exchange or Google Workspace (formerly GSuite). But it\u2019s capable of running without calendar integrations.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\nThe main view gives a visual orientation on the floor plan including custom orientation objects like doors, walls, copy machines. This view shows red and green elements, giving the reservation status of desks or workstations.\nOn each floor, customers can choose to operate big overview displays or tablets. All users can access the floor plans also on their PCs/smartphones. Users are in the situation of asking \u201cWhich desk is free for how many hours?\u201d or \u201cWhere is the desk I booked yesterday?\u201d. In a walk-in booking, users can check for availability based on time slots or check the layout plan. This is a visual search for free space. Another use case supported here is: \u201c26 of 40 desks are free but I want to sit close to my team leader whom I can see over there\u201d. The booking is done by pressing on the desk.\nThe booking for future days usually works in a way that users specify the location and day. The free tables can be recognized by their green coloring. Through additional color coding, it is apparent whether a desk is occupied for the full day, booked only for the morning or for the afternoon. The bookings of the colleagues are listed with their names. Select and confirm - done. If there are special requirements for the workplace, these can be called up via additional information (e.g. two monitors or specific equipment). Pictures can also be stored. Accepted reservations are confirmed by email and include links to import calendar entries for Outlook, Google calendar or other client programs.\n\n\nAdvanced Upgrade Options\n\n\nIf one has arrived at the last meters, there are further concepts to support wayfinding or to display the status. Optional mini-displays showing the booking status on each desk - similar to a digital meeting room door sign. Some customers prefer to have one tablet display for a group of desks inside the open office. To save hardware costs for tablets, android boxes could be implemented as well. Those are connected to the existing monitors as a 2nd HDMI input source. Another option is to integrate 3rd party standalone programmable LEDs to give visibility from distance. Depending on the customer\u2019s requirements, occupancy can be processed using sensors. The solution can be deployed within a day. In big office environments with hundreds of desks it needs a project approach to satisfy individual requirements like advanced integrations.",

            "ABOUT": "Summary and Relevance for Covid-19 Desk Sharing is a solution for desk reservations. It has become more and more relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic with its regulations like safety distances. Office administrators can comply with latest policies by increasing or decreasing the number of available desks. Some companies expanded during the pandemic, hiring home office workers. The new workers didn\u2019t get a dedicated desk and there is simply not enough space for everybody. Plus, eve \u201cHome office is here to stay\u201d. Why bother about creating more office space? Just make sure to avoid overbooking on popular days and monitor desk utilization.\nAnother case for many companies around the globe is: 2020-2021 did not go as planned. If you need to downsize the office space due to cost reduction, desk sharing is the perfect solution to support hybrid work.\nWith the Desk Sharing solution, users easily see available desks in real time on the browser or via dedicated displays on site. The booking covers the walk-in situation for the next hours and supports those users who like to plan the next weeks from home. The latter can do convenient multi-bookings for the days they\u2019re planning to visit the office.\nThe solution can be deployed based on programs like O635, Microsoft Exchange or Google Workspace (formerly GSuite). But it\u2019s capable of running without calendar integrations.\n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\nThe main view gives a visual orientation on the floor plan including custom orientation objects like doors, walls, copy machines. This view shows red and green elements, giving the reservation status of desks or workstations.\nOn each floor, customers can choose to operate big overview displays or tablets. All users can access the floor plans also on their PCs/smartphones. Users are in the situation of asking \u201cWhich desk is free for how many hours?\u201d or \u201cWhere is the desk I booked yesterday?\u201d. In a walk-in booking, users can check for availability based on time slots or check the layout plan. This is a visual search for free space. Another use case supported here is: \u201c26 of 40 desks are free but I want to sit close to my team leader whom I can see over there\u201d. The booking is done by pressing on the desk.\nThe booking for future days usually works in a way that users specify the location and day. The free tables can be recognized by their green coloring. Through additional color coding, it is apparent whether a desk is occupied for the full day, booked only for the morning or for the afternoon. The bookings of the colleagues are listed with their names. Select and confirm - done. If there are special requirements for the workplace, these can be called up via additional information (e.g. two monitors or specific equipment). Pictures can also be stored. Accepted reservations are confirmed by email and include links to import calendar entries for Outlook, Google calendar or other client programs.\n\n\nAdvanced Upgrade Options\n\n\nIf one has arrived at the last meters, there are further concepts to support wayfinding or to display the status. Optional mini-displays showing the booking status on each desk - similar to a digital meeting room door sign. Some customers prefer to have one tablet display for a group of desks inside the open office. To save hardware costs for tablets, android boxes could be implemented as well. Those are connected to the existing monitors as a 2nd HDMI input source. Another option is to integrate 3rd party standalone programmable LEDs to give visibility from distance. Depending on the customer\u2019s requirements, occupancy can be processed using sensors. The solution can be deployed within a day. In big office environments with hundreds of desks it needs a project approach to satisfy individual requirements like advanced integrations.",

Lightning Fast Continuous Localization Setup [10 minutes]: .ere's what it takes for a native iOS app to go from a single language app to a multilingual app. \n(1) Developer sets up upload integration with Xcode build system [takes 1 minute]\n(2) Strings will collect and compile all untranslated strings from Objective-C, XiB, Storyboards, etc. [takes 1 minute]\n(3) Strings will generate and compile translation context cues to feed AI translation engine [takes 1 minute]\n(4) Developer chooses languages they would like to support [takes 30 seconds]\n(5) Strings immediately starts translating and sends notification once translations are done [5 minutes]\n(6) Developer sets up download integration with Xcode build system [takes 1 minute]\n(7) Strings integrates translations back into Xcode project and triggers pull request in CI/CD process [takes 30 seconds]\n\nAnd you're done! Continuous localization is setup and now every time developers push new features, Strings will work in the background to ensure they have multilingual support. \n\nIt's seriously that easy :)",

This reduces latency and allows for real-time decision making.\n\nScalability**: Cloud computing provides virtually unlimited storage and processing power, enabling the system to scale as per the business requirements.\n\nSecurity**: Both edge and cloud computing offer robust security measures to protect sensitive data and IoT devices from cyber threats.\n\nCost Savings**: By reducing the need for extensive data transport and offering pay-as-you-go models, businesses can save significant costs.\n\nThe integration with Operational Technology (OT) further enhances the capabilities of the Infodeck solution. OT integration allows for seamless communication between the IoT devices and the management systems, enabling real-time monitoring and control of physical devices and industrial processes. This leads to improved efficiency, safety, and productivity in the operational environment.\n\nIn summary, the Infodeck solution provides a holistic, integrated approach to managing and optimizing business operations. It leverages advanced technologies to provide actionable insights, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.",
